Project Description:

Pazaak - A card game from a game called Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. A popular card game that was played back in the Star Wars Old Republic era. The game is similar to blackjack but it has a twist where the player can manipulate their given number to achieve the winning number. The goal is to get closest to the number 20 or get exactly 20 without going over it. The player with the highest score less than or equal to 20 wins the round. Whoever wins three rounds within a match is the winner of the game.
